# Problem Sheet 3: Jupyter, numpy and pyplot
#### *Emerging Technologies - Lecturer: [Dr Ian McLoughlin](ianmcloughlin.github.io) - 4th Year (Hons) Software Development*
This repository will contain solutions to [problem sheet 3](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/jupyter.html) for [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/) 4th year module. The problem sheet revolves around implementing Iris flower dataset using jupyter, numpy and pyplot.

### **_Solutions can be found above in [IrisDataSet.ipynb](https://github.com/ianburkeixiv/JupyterPyplotNumpy/blob/master/IrisDataSet.ipynb)_**

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. It used to be called IPython Notebook but has been renamed and moved to the Jupyter project.

# Numpy
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is a library for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

# Pyplot  
[Pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) is a module in matplotlib which is a plotting library for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.
Pyplot provides the state-machine interface to the underlying plotting library in matplotlib. This means that figures and axes are implicitly and automatically created to achieve the desired plot. For example, calling plot from pyplot will automatically create the necessary figure and axes to achieve the desired plot. Setting a title will then automatically set that title to the current axes object:
